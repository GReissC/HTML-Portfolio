    <h3>What do I strive for?</h3>
    <p>I've always had a passion for technology, so when I entered college, I made a goal for myself to work hard and provide the best service my costumers could receive, to ensure their satisfaction. My goal is to one day see my projects being used as an example of stellar work in the development community.</p>

        <br>

        <li>Campus_Hub <br>
            <p>A website developed during college to help students find educational events, like lectures or congresses.

In this project, I worked mainly in the UX/UI area, making sure our target customers would find the website easy to use, and enjoyable.</p> <br>
