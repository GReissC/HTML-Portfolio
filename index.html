        <p>I've always had a passion for technology, so when I entered college, I made a goal for myself to work hard
            and
            provide the best service my costumers could receive, to ensure their satisfaction. My goal is to one day see
            my
            projects being used as an example of stellar work in the development community.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Projects I've worked on:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Movie List <br>
                <p>A simple website meant to display the basics of HTML, and some movies I like.</p> <br>
                <img src="./assets/movies.png" height="300px" alt="A print of Guilherme's best movies project."> <br>
                <a href="./public/bestMovies.html">Link to the webpage</a>
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>Birthday Party Invite <br>
                <p>Another simple website meant to display knowledge about anchors and image elements, done entirely in
                    HTML
                </p> <br>
                <img src="./assets/invite.png" height="300px" alt="A print of Guilherme's birthday invite project.">

            </li>
            <br>

            <li>Campus_Hub <br>
                <p>A website developed during college to help students find educational events, like lectures or
                    congresses.
                    Organizers can create the events on the website, and students would confirm their presence on it. In
                    this project, I worked mainly in the UX/UI area, making sure our target customers would find the
                    website
                    easy to use, and enjoyable.</p> <br>

            <li>Nexus <br>
                <p>Another website developed during college, Nexus had the initial idea to be a website focused on
                    helping
                    small developers find their footing in the market, mainly small game developers. The project was
                    discontinued in favor of Campus_Hub.</p> <br>
